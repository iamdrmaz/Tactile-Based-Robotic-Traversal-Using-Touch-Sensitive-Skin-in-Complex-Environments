Combining tactile innovation and AI, I develop robots with touch-sensitive ‘skin’ for navigating confined spaces. Inspired by biology, my research integrates advanced algorithms, predictive modeling, and bio-inspired design to enhance autonomous robotic traversal in visually challenging environments.
